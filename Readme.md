# My DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository! 

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn Data Structures and Algorithms. I'll be posting my daily progress, code implementations, and explanations of various DSA concepts as I explore them.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository:

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sameer-panwar/DSA
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd DSA
    ```
3. Compile and run the code:
    ```bash
    g++ program.cpp
    for windows ./a.out
    for linux/macOS ./a.exe

    ```

## Daily Progress

I'll be updating this section with my daily learning progress.

### Day 1: 2024-09-02
- Started with basic data structures like arrays.
- Implemented some pyramid patters, butterfly patterns and diamond patters in C++.

### Day 2: 2024-09-03
- Explored some searching Algorithms in array.
- Solved some basic questions from the tutoiral.

### Day 3: 2024-09-04
-Explored some of the Sorting Algorithms in Array.




## Topics Covered

This section will list the DSA topics I've covered, along with links to the corresponding code files.
